            <p>Hi lets start with a normal introduction. My name is Mandy Jelley, yes I know I have a weird name but thats not the weird part of my life. 
        I am 38 years old. I married my soulmate and bestfriend who I met over 17 years ago and have been inseperable since. We have been through some really amazing times and some not so great but the good always outweighs the bad.
        We have 2 amazing daughters who are smart, funny, and caring. They know how to make me smile when I am having a tough day. They brighten up the dullest of rooms with their energy, their smile makes others smile and their laugh is infectious.
        I know I am waffling on a bit you really want to know the weird part of my life and I am just getting there I promise.

    <h2>The Weird Part of my life</h2>
    <p>So the weird part of my life is what makes me weird and wonderful. 
        I have a rare(not so rare)condition called Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It makes me incredibly flexible in all my joints, kind of like Elastigirl in the film The Incredibles. Its my version of a super power even when its not so super at times and more difficult to live with. Ill give you a quick rundown of what Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (which is also known as hEDS) is and then how it affects me.
    </p>

        <h2>What is Hypermobile</h2>
            <p>The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of thirteen individual genetic conditions, all of which affect the body’s connective tissue. Connective tissue lies between other tissues and organs, keeping these separate whilst connecting them, holding everything in place and providing support, like the mortar between bricks. In EDS, a gene mutation causes a certain kind of connective tissue (the kind will depend on the type of EDS but usually a form of collage) to be fragile and stretchy. This stretchiness can sometimes be seen in the skin of someone with EDS; individuals with the condition may also be able to extend their joints further than is usual – this is known as being hypermobile, bendy or double-jointed. As collagen is present throughout the body, people with EDS tend to experience a broad range of symptoms, most of them less visible than the skin and joint differences. These are complex syndromes affecting many systems of the body at once, despite this EDS is often an invisible disability. Symptoms commonly include, but are not limited to, long-term pain, chronic fatigue, dizziness, palpitations and digestive disorders. Such problems and their severity vary considerably from person to person, even in the same type of EDS and within the same family.</p>
                <ul>Here is just a few of the things linked to EDS;
                    <li>Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome(POTS)</li>
                    <li>Gut dysmotility(Chronic Constipation, Slow gut transit, Severe IBS, Gastroparesis)</li>
                    <li>Diverticulitis</li>
                    <li>Raynauds</li>
                    <li>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</li>
                    <li>Organ Failure</li>
                </ul>

    <h2>My life living with hEDS</h2>
        <p>So for me living my youth life with what I was told was "just double jointed" was great I was bendy more so than most of my friends even the ones who went to acrobatics/gymnastics. I did have very weak ankles growing up and often sprained my ankles just by standing on a small stone was enough for me to go over/sprain them. I remember my brother who was about 4 or 5 years old was playing with his golf set and I had a swollen ankle from spraining it at school while wearing white patterned socks which made my ankle looked like a golf ball my brother accidently hit my ankle with his golf club. Im still not so sure it was an accident. The fun things I taught myself how to do split, flips and more before I went to acrobatics when I was about 11 years old. I had no idea how weird my life was about to become. I went to college at the age of 17 and thats where I suffered my first dislocation. 
        </p>
    <h3>My First dislocation and college</h3>
        <p>I was 2 weeks off being 18 years old when I stood up from sitting on my bed in my dorm room and I crumbled to the floor. I had no idea at the time but I had Dislocated and relocated my right patella. I was taken to a near by hospital who xrayed my knee and told me there was no way I could have dislocated or subluxed(partially dislocated) my knee as I would be in way more pain and wouldnt be able to stand on it. I was told to go rest it for a couple days and then I could start to go back to my usual routine slowly  
            I tried to rest for a few days in my dorm room, not moving much apart from going to the toliet which I had an en-suite dorm room so made it easy enough for me to go to the toilet and I had some amazing friends who helped me right along the way.
            After resting a few days I went back to class and I thought all went well. It did go well until I went to my class mates dorm room after classes had finished and it was time to let loose a bit. I literally took 2 steps into my friends dorm and down I went. The pain I won't forget. I had fully dislocated my right patella again but this time I landed on it badly. It was that bad I knew I had to go home from college. My Papa came all the way down to collect me, it's a day I will never forget. My roommate had packed all my things into my case and got it all ready to go home for me. My college headteacher had to wheel me out on a computer chair to the car and it was so cold, the middle of winter. Where the college is was coverered in snow, everywhere I looked it was so lovely and white. I had taken some painkillers earlier that morning so I knew the car journey wouldn't be too painful for me. 
            The full hour and a half car journey home was horrible. I didn't want to leave, I didn't want to have to go home missing lessons, missung friends, missing on oppertunities that others were getting or the fun they were having and knowing deep down that was the beggining of the end of my vet nurnsing career even before it had began. While I knew I had to go try recover, try get better, try fix what I didn't know was just the start of my EDS journey. My only solace on that car journey was that everything looked so pretty, the glistening grass, the trees that were so white with tiny drops of water that had frozen at the ends of the branches looking like little diamonds shining so bright. It was such a beautiful place to be and at that time it looked even nicer than I had ever remembered seeing before on the multiple journey's I have taken over the years. That journehy made me appreciate exactly what I do have and where I live in the World. I live in the most beautiful part of the world and I appreciate everyting about it from the smallest blade of grass to the largest of trees, from the smallest mouse to the biggest stag. Its amazing just to be alive and living here. I know strange thing to say when i am in pain and leaving behind my college life but in all honesty just opening my eyes seeing what is out there helped me and still to this day helps me.
            I arrived home and couldn't stand so my mum placed my matteress on the floor and that is where I slept and spent a week. It was that bad I was going to the toilet in a basin that I basically used like a bed pan. I know I really should have been in hospital but I didn't want to as I had been seen at the hospital when it first happened and I thought I just needed to rest more and it would all be back to normal soon. How wrong I was!
            After the week had passed and the bruising and swelling started to get better my mum helped me get up and moving. She really was my rock and still is one of my rocks. The weeks past the knee got better but it was so loose way more loose than before which I learned my new limits and kept going.
